# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then we created a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares by each city type.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The data is as you would expect. The more people in a given area, the greater the total fare earned in a week. So Urban areas earn more each week than suburban with rural areas earning the least amount in any given week. Each city type also seem to have the same difference each week. Urban areas had a total of 1,625 rides compared to 625 rides in suburban areas and 125 rides in rural areas.

total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
